# Poker Player

This is an attempt to create a poker playing program, in both Python and C++. Primarily, when starting out the project I'm going to be sticking to Python, before moving to C++ to see if I can bring in more structure to my program

Credit for the idea goes to Aryaman Ladha, a former classmate of mine, from one of his courses.

### Main Concept

I'm going to be breaking down my problem into the following sections, and I hope that this turns out better than my Sudoku project. The sections I have in mind are

-> creating a system of cards, and displaying card values probably via classes and objects
-> creating a ranking system of *HANDS* so to speak, the 10 hands that can appear in most versions of Poker
-> implementing the rules of poker into the program
and finally
-> trying to implement a poker playing algorithm for the computer to play against the human player
